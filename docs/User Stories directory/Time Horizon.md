## Time Horizon

Idea: As a user, I want to be able to input a time horizon so I can understand trends in sentiment based on time. 

By getting the sentiment score of a movie or tv show through all time, we are getting an aggregate score of general sentiment over time, which is useful for the purpose of understanding on a basic level how it was received. However, by inputting a time horizon, users are able to retrieve much more granular detail, such as: 1) how sentiment changed over time as a result of social or other trends; 2) how a specific episode of a show was received; and 3) how a specific event affected sentiment, such as one of the actors receiving an award. The option of including a time horizon opens up the software to many more use cases.
