## Search History

Idea: As a user, I want to keep track of my search history on the website to easily click on movies/tv shows that I previously searched and see how sentiment has changed.

When navigating on the app, similar to Instagram, there will be a search page. The user will be able to input any TV Show or Movie and the search page will automatically look for tweets that have the hashtag of that movie. For example, if I search for the TV-Show: 'Euphoria', the search page (through the API) will search for all recent tweets that have the hashtag #Euphoria, additionally it will search through all IMBD scores for this TV-Show. After the results of the sentiment analysis come up, the user will be able to see their recent search for Euphoria, under the search bar icon (similar to Instagram). As new searches are made, the most recent searches will show up at the top of the list and the least recent searches will show up at the bottom of the list. At any given moment the user can click on any search they had made and the sentiment analysis will occur again to show them the new results. Assuming the user searches approx. one movie a day, the user will only be able to see there 30 most recent searches.
