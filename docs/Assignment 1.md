## Project Proposal 1: Rating of Movies and TV Shows

Our first idea centers around the ability for the user to understand what people are saying recently regarding TV shows and Movies. The user would be able to input the title of the TV show or movie to get a score based on Twitter and IMDB reviews. Using the hashtag tool on Twitter we would pull tweets that are written about these shows and movies and run them through the Stanford Sentiment Treebank, which analyzes the sentiment of the text to return a score ranging from 1-20. We would do the same procedure with the IMDB reviews and average the two scores given from the sentiment analysis to return a consolidated score for the user.

## Project Proposal 2: Create Meals with Leftover Ingredients

Our second idea gives the user the ability to create a meal with whatever ingredients are left in their fridge. The user would input what ingredients they have left over and we would use the MEAL DB API to return a list of meals that are possible with those ingredients. Then we would pull the nutritional values from the US department of agriculture dataset for the specific ingredients that are selected and include that with the meal that is created.
