**Project Overview**

From a high-level view, this repository contains the documentation for a project based around analyzing sentiment of movies from two sources: Twitter and IMDB. It is still a work in progress, as many features could be added to enhance the user experience.

**Web Flow Design**

On the back end, we used the Django framework with Python as the coding language. On the front end, we used the React framework with Javascript as the coding language. Additionally, Django allowed us to pull the data from the RESTful APIs.

**Features**

The application utilizes Google sign-in in order to track the search history of users. The user is prompted to sign in upon the opening of Moviester. Once the user signs in, they are automatically redirected to the "movie search" page. 

**What's Left**

There are numerous features that can be added to improve the overall experience of the user on Moviester. 

- As we planned at the beginning, we'd like to add a time horizon feature to allow the user to specify a specifically time period from which to receive the sentiment score. This would give the application many more use cases.
- We'd like to improve the overall UI, make it a bit more readable, as some aspects are clunky
- Add some potential social aspects, such as a tweet generator
- We will continue to hypothesize as we build to add more features, however small, that will tangibly benefit the user.
