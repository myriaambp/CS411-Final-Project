## Framework Decisions

# Frontend

We narrowed our choices down to React and Angular fairly quickly -- since many of us have little to no experience with web apps, we knew that we would want to take advantage of their high popularity so that we would be able to look to the experiences of others for help whenever we hit a stumbling block. After looking around for a bit, we found many more beginner-friendly guides for React, and so we were much more comfortable starting with it.

# Backend

A lot of us felt most comfortable working with Python, so again we were able to narrow down our framework choices to two quite fast -- Django or Flask. We realised that our project was going to be fairly small-scale, so Flask's more minimalist and flexible nature seemed better suited to our project. We definitely did a bit of experimenting too, though; you may still see references to Django in other parts and branches of this repo!
