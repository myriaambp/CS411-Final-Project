# User Stories

* As a user, I want to be able to input my favorite movie or TV show to see what people are saying about it. When I open the app, there should be an easily-findable search bar to use, and I should be able to input the title of the movie to search for it. If I only remember part of the title, or if there are a few movies with the same title, I should see all possibly relevant results, so that I can pick the one I care about. This should be all I need to do to see what people are saying about the movie; I want the app to handle everything and give me a easily-understandable metric that informs me about what I wanted to know. As an exception, if the app is not able to find enough relevant information, I still want to see its best guess at analysing public opinion about the movie or TV show in question, while still being informed that it's not working off a lot of information.

* As a user, I want to be able to input a time horizon so I can understand trends in sentiment based on time

* As a user, I want to be given a few example tweets that are used in the sentiment analysis to get further indication of what people are saying

* As a user, I want to be able to see what people are talking about the most so I can see what is popular right now for me to watch

* As a user, I want to be able to logout from the website to protect my personal details

* As a user, I want to keep track of my search history on the website to easily click on movies/tv shows that I previously searched and see how sentiment has changed

* As a user, I want to get a percentage indication of negative vs. positive tweets to further understand sentiment on a more granular level
