## Trending Shows

**Original Idea**

Idea: As a user, I want to be able to see what people are talking about the most so I can see what is popular right now for me to watch.

I may not have any particular show in mind to watch, and instead just be looking for anything that might pique my interests. As such, when I log in to the app, I want to easily see shows that a lot of people have been talking about recently on Twitter. My tastes might also be different from just what is most popular, so I would also want to see what users like me have been looking up recently. I should also be able to easily click on any of the listed movies so that I can see further details about it, similar to what I would see if I were looking up an individual show. I should be able to see all these details on the list of popular shows, so that I can compare what people are saying about each show.

**Revision**

While this feature has not been added yet, we consider this as high priority to implement. It creates a social buzz around the app, allowing it to adapt to what is happening rather than being a static searching application.
